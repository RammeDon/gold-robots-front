                Investing is the process of buying assets that increase in value over time and
                provide returns in the form of income payments or capital gains. In a larger
                sense, investing can also be about spending time or money to improve your own
                life or the lives of others. But in the world of finance, investing is the purchase
                of securities, real estate and other items of value in the pursuit of capital gains
                or income. Throughout history, few investments have rivaled gold in popularity
                as a hedge against almost any kind of trouble, from inflation to economic
                upheaval or currency fluctuations, to war.
                When you think about investing in gold, don’t restrict yourself to just buying
                physical gold, like coins or bullion. Alternatives to invest in gold include buying
                shares of gold mining companies or gold <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/what-are-etfs/">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs). You
                can also invest in gold by trading options and futures contracts.
